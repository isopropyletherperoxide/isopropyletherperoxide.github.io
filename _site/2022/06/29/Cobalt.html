        <h1>Synthesis of Hexaaquocobalt (II) Hydrogen Phthalate [Cobalt (II) Phthalate]</h1>
<p>29 Jun 2022 - me :3</p>
<div class="blog_box">
<p>In this post I will describe a semi-successful (?) preparation of a Cobalt (II) Phthalate complex. <br />
While I’m pretty sure the complex did form, I highly suspect the high solubility of it fucked me over and I got some Potassium Hydrogen Phtalate (KHP from now on) contamination in it. But the end result was still satisfying.<br />
<br />
2.81 grams of Cobalt (II) Sulfate Heptahydrate and 6.66 grams of KHP were added to a beaker, and dissolved in ~150ml of boiling hot water. The resulting solution was evaporated down to the 10ml mark and left to cool. On cooling a precipitate of light-pink crystals was formed, and was filtered on a buchner funnel, washed with cold water, chloroform (probably didn’t help) and isopropanol, and then was left to dry in the sunlight. <br />

Dried, the crystals slightly changed colour to a more lavender colour, which is accurate to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja01621a014">literature</a>.<br /></p>

<p>In the end, 2.48 grams of the complex were obtained, which is <em>~75%</em> of theoretical yield.
