This complex has been of my interest for quite a long while now, but I couldn't make it because of lack of reagents or my inability to find a good procedure for it. <br> <br>
Now, that I'm generally better at inorganic chemistry, I've managed to adapt an old preparation of it for the modern (home) chemist. (I'm **not** using lead as an oxidizer) 

## Sodium Cobalt Nitrite
1.54 grams of cobalt (II) sulfate hexahydrate (0.01 mol) were dissolved in 7.5 ml of water with the help of strong stirring and heating. A similar solution of 13.6 grams (0.2 mol) of sodium nitrite in 7.5 ml was also prepared with the help of strong heating and stirring. 


The nitrite solution was placed on a stirring hotplate, and the cobalt sulfate solution was added to it at once with no visible colour change. 

After letting it stir for a little while, 5 ml of glacial acetic acid were added, after which the solution heated up considerably, and released an amount of terrible red NO2 gas. 



Once gas evolution subsided, ~20 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide were slowly added, and the solution was left stirring for about 10 minutes. 



The solution was vacuum filtered, and the precipitate discarded. This is a solution of the highly soluble sodium salt of the nitro complex. 

## Potassium Cobalt Nitrite
A solution of ~5 grams of potassium chloride was prepared in warm distilled water, and the brown-red sodium salt solution was added to it at once. A yellow precipitate was formed and allowed to settle for 10 minutes. The precipitate was vacuum filtered on a fritted glass buchner funnel (the particle size clogs paper filters), and washed with distilled water.

The solid was allowed to dry in a desiccator overnight, and then in hot air, to speed up the drying process (I am very impatient).

The final yield as 4.52 grams, which is 46% of theoretical.
