In this post I will describe a semi-successful (?) preparation of a Cobalt (II) Phthalate complex. <br>
While I'm pretty sure the complex did form, I highly suspect the high solubility of it fucked me over and I got some Potassium Hydrogen Phtalate (KHP from now on) contamination in it. But the end result was still satisfying.<br>
<br>
2.81 grams of Cobalt (II) Sulfate Heptahydrate and 6.66 grams of KHP were added to a beaker, and dissolved in ~150ml of boiling hot water. The resulting solution was evaporated down to the 10ml mark and left to cool. On cooling a precipitate of light-pink crystals was formed, and was filtered on a buchner funnel, washed with cold water, chloroform (probably didn't help) and isopropanol, and then was left to dry in the sunlight. <br>

Dried, the crystals slightly changed colour to a more lavender colour, which is accurate to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja01621a014">literature</a>.<br>

In the end, 2.48 grams of the complex were obtained, which is *~75%* of theoretical yield.
